        <Paragraph>
          The most beneficial advantage of using pesticides is their
          effectiveness against pests that could easily destroy crops in their
          entirety, devastating whole fields at a time. By controlling insect
          and rodent populations, pesticides help prevent the spreading of
          diseases. Insecticides protect buildings from termite infestations. By
          eliminating predators that would destroy crops and raise the cost of
          corn and cotton, pesticides keep the price of clothing and food down.
          Pesticides are even put to use in operating rooms to clean and
          disinfect surgical instruments and other equipment to keep the rooms
          and materials sterile and free of bacteria and microbial life forms.

                Acaricides are pesticides that kill members of the arachnid
                subclass Acari, which includes ticks and mites. Acaricides are

              <Paragraph>
                Diseases are a major source of crop and plant damage that can be
                caused by a number of plant pathogenic (disease-causing)
                organisms. Fungi are the number one cause of crop loss
                worldwide. Viruses, nematodes, and bacteria also cause diseases
                in plants. Symptoms resembling those caused by pathogens can be
                caused by abiotic (non-living) factors, such as nutrient
                deficiency and air pollution, and also insects.
                <br />
                Fungicides, herbicides and insecticides are all pesticides used
                in plant protection. A fungicide is a specific type of pesticide
                that controls fungal disease by specifically inhibiting or
                killing the fungus causing the disease. Not all diseases caused
                by fungi can be adequately controlled by fungicides. These
                include the vascular diseases Fusarium and Verticillium wilt.
                Diseases caused by other types of organisms, disorders caused by
                abiotic factors, and insect damage are not controlled by
                fungicides. Thus it is essential to first determine the cause of
                symptoms before applying a fungicide.

              <Paragraph>
                Just as pesticide is used to rid an area of unwanted pests,
                herbicide is used to get rid of unwanted plant life, like weeds,
                brush, unproductive bushes or trees, and other growth that takes
                nutrients away from crops and other useful plants. Many are
                synthetic and can be toxic to "good" plants, as well as to
                animals and humans. While there are organic varieties, it is
                important for people who are using these products to read the
                labels carefully to insure that people, pets, livestock and
                useful vegetation won't be harmed by their use.
                <br />
                Herbicides are available in two main types: non-selective and
                selective. The non-selective variety is used to kill all growth
                and is generally reserved for agricultural use or for clearing
                large or heavily overgrown areas. On the other hand, a selective
                herbicide is used to target certain types of plant life. This
                form works to curb growth, usually through some type of hormone
                disruption, and should not affect other vegetation.
                <br />
                For the home gardener, a non-selective herbicide is rarely
                required. An organic, selective product is the better choice for
                maintaining grass and home gardens. Farmers, orchard owners,
                developers and park services may use non-selective forms to
                treat large areas and prepare land for future use.

              <Paragraph>
                Insecticides are chemicals used to control insects by killing
                them or preventing them from engaging in behaviors deemed
                undesirable or destructive. They are classified based on their
                structure and mode of action. Many insecticides act upon the
                nervous system of the insect (e.g., Cholinesterase (ChE)
                inhibition) while others act as growth regulators or endotoxins.
                Insecticides are commonly used in agricultural, public health,
                and industrial applications, as well as household and commercial
                uses (e.g., control of roaches and termites).
                <br />
                Insecticides are applied in various formulations and delivery
                systems (e.g., sprays, baits, slow-release diffusion) that
                influence their transport and chemical transformation.
                Mobilization of insecticides can occur via runoff, either
                dissolved or sorbed to soil particles, atmospheric deposition
                (primarily spray drift), or sub-surface flow. Some insecticides
                are accumulated by aquatic organisms and transferred to their
                predators. Insecticides are designed to be lethal to insects.
